# TextEditor
Allows to classify parts of a text into three different options "Affection, Appreciation and Judgement"

This program was designed for the Software Engineer class

The program is part of a bigger proyect where users evaluate different texts in order to determine what kind of
writing they're facing, the classifications could be "Affection, Appreciation and Judgement".

The application needs to have a login in which evaluators and admins can log into.

Evaluators can log in and open certain files to evaluate them 

Administrators can add new evaluators and admins, they can also compare all the evaluato's evaluations (lol) and
create a new file with all the comparisons.

I did some cheating, sorry, i was running out of time :(
