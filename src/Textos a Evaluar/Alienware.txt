Alienware is an American computer hardware subsidiary of Dell. Their products are designed for gaming and can be identified by
their alien-themed designs.[5] Alienware was founded in 1996 by Nelson Gonzalez and Alex Aguila. The company's corporate headquarters 
is located in The Hammocks, in Miami, Florida.[6]
History
Established in 1996 as Sakai of Miami, Inc. by Nelson Gonzalez and Alex Aguila, Alienware assembles desktops, notebooks, workstations,
and PC gaming consoles. According to employees, the name "Alienware" was chosen because of the founders' fondness for the hit television
series The X-Files, which also inspired the science-fiction themed names of product lines such as Area-51, Hangar 18, and Aurora.[10] In 1997,
it changed its name to Alienware.
Acquisition and current status
Dell had considered buying the Alienware company since 2002, but did not agree to purchase the company until March 22, 2006.[11][12] 
The new subsidiary retains control of its design and marketing while benefiting from Dell's purchasing power, economies of scale, and
supply chain, which lowered its operating costs.[12]
Initially, Dell maintained its competing XPS line of gaming PCs, often selling computers with similar specifications, which may have hurt
Alienware's market share within its market segment.[13][14] Due to corporate restructuring in the spring of 2008, the XPS brand was scaled down,
and the Desktop line was eliminated leaving only the XPS Notebooks.[14] Product development of gaming PCs was consolidated with Dell's gaming division,
with Alienware becoming Dell's premier gaming brand.[15][16] On June 2, 2009, The M17x was introduced as the first Alienware/Dell branded system.
This launch also expanded Alienware’s global reach from 6 to 35 countries while supporting 17 different languages.
